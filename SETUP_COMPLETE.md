# ✅ Qdrant MCP Server Setup Complete!

## Current Status

The Qdrant MCP server is now running with HTTP/SSE transport to avoid Windows stdio issues.

### Server Status
- **Running at:** http://localhost:8765/sse
- **Transport:** SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- **Storage:** In-memory (:memory:)
- **Status:** ✅ ACTIVE

### Available Tools
Once Cursor is restarted, you'll have access to:
1. **qdrant-find** - Search for stored memories
2. **qdrant-store** - Store new information

## How to Use

### Step 1: Keep the Server Running
The server is currently running in the background. To start it manually in the future:
```batch
start_mcp_server.bat
```

### Step 2: Restart Cursor
**Important:** You must restart Cursor for the changes to take effect.
1. Close all Cursor windows
2. Reopen Cursor
3. Check for the MCP icon/status

### Step 3: Use the Tools
After restart, you can use the tools in Cursor:
- Type `@qdrant-store` to save information
- Type `@qdrant-find` to search memories

## Configuration Details

Your Cursor MCP configuration has been updated:
- **Config file:** `C:\Users\Cedric\.cursor\mcp.json`
- **Server entry:** `qdrant` pointing to `http://localhost:8765/sse`

## Troubleshooting

If tools don't appear after restart:
1. Ensure the server is running (check with `verify_http_server.py`)
2. Check Cursor's Developer Console for errors (Help → Toggle Developer Tools)
3. Verify the config file exists at `C:\Users\Cedric\.cursor\mcp.json`

## Why HTTP Instead of Stdio?

We switched from stdio to HTTP/SSE transport because:
- Windows has issues with subprocess stdin pipe communication
- The error `[Errno 22] Invalid argument` occurs with stdio on Windows
- HTTP/SSE transport bypasses these platform-specific issues

## Files Created

- `run_http_server.py` - The HTTP/SSE server launcher
- `start_mcp_server.bat` - Convenient batch file to start the server
- `verify_http_server.py` - Script to verify server is running

The server is configured to use SiliconFlow's embedding API with the Qwen3-Embedding-8B model.
