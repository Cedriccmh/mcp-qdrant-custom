# üêõ Critical Bug Fix: Async Wrapper Issue

## Problem
The `mcp_qdrant_qdrant-find` tool was returning **no response** (empty content array) even though:
- The server was running correctly
- The database had data (10 points)
- The search function worked when called directly

## Root Cause
The helper functions `wrap_filters()` and `make_partial_function()` were creating **synchronous wrappers around async functions**, causing the coroutines to never be awaited.

### Code Before (BROKEN)
```python
# In wrap_filters.py
def wrap_filters(original_func, filterable_fields):
    @wraps(original_func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):  # <- NOT ASYNC!
        # ...
        return original_func(**kwargs, query_filter=query_filter)  # <- NOT AWAITED!
```

When FastMCP called the wrapped `find` function:
1. The sync wrapper was called
2. It returned a coroutine object (not executed)
3. FastMCP received the coroutine, not the actual results
4. Result: Empty content array

## Solution
Modified both helper functions to detect async functions and create async wrappers:

### Files Changed
1. **`src/mcp_server_qdrant/common/wrap_filters.py`**
   - Added `inspect.iscoroutinefunction()` check
   - Created separate async and sync wrapper functions
   - Properly await async functions

2. **`src/mcp_server_qdrant/common/func_tools.py`**
   - Added same async/sync wrapper logic
   - Ensures async functions are properly awaited

### Code After (FIXED)
```python
# In wrap_filters.py
def wrap_filters(original_func, filterable_fields):
    is_async = inspect.iscoroutinefunction(original_func)
    
    if is_async:
        @wraps(original_func)
        async def async_wrapper(*args, **kwargs):  # <- NOW ASYNC!
            # ...
            return await original_func(**kwargs, query_filter=query_filter)  # <- PROPERLY AWAITED!
        wrapper = async_wrapper
    else:
        @wraps(original_func)
        def sync_wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # ...
            return original_func(**kwargs, query_filter=query_filter)
        wrapper = sync_wrapper
```

## Verification

### Before Fix

### After Fix
```
Testing query: 'python programming'
Content length: 1
Found 10 results including:
- Python is a versatile programming language...
- FastAPI is a modern Python web framework...
- The Qdrant vector database enables semantic search...
(and 7 more results)
```

## How to Apply Fix

1. **Restart the MCP server**
   ```powershell
   # Kill old server
   netstat -ano | findstr "8765" | findstr "LISTENING"  # Get PID
   taskkill /F /PID <PID>
   
   # Start new server
   uv run python run_http_server.py
   ```

2. **Restart Cursor** (IMPORTANT!)
   - Close all Cursor windows
   - Reopen Cursor
   - Wait for MCP connection to establish

3. **Test the tool**
   ```
   Use mcp_qdrant_qdrant-find to search for: python programming
   ```

## Expected Behavior
- The tool should now return formatted results with entries
- Each entry contains content and metadata
- Semantic search finds relevant results based on meaning

## Technical Details

### Why This Bug Was Hard to Catch
1. The wrappers had correct signatures (thanks to `@wraps` and manual signature manipulation)
2. FastMCP could call the functions without errors
3. The functions returned something (a coroutine object), not None
4. The coroutine was never executed, so it appeared to "work" but with empty results

### Why The Fix Works
1. `inspect.iscoroutinefunction()` correctly identifies async functions
2. Async wrapper properly awaits the result
3. FastMCP receives the actual list of strings, not a coroutine
4. Results are properly formatted and returned to the client

## Status
‚úÖ **FIXED** - Verified with direct MCP client test
‚ö†Ô∏è  **Cursor restart required** - Cursor needs to reconnect to the updated server

## Testing Commands

```powershell
# Test with Python MCP client
uv run python test_tool_detailed.py

# Test direct search
uv run python debug_qdrant_search.py

# Check server status
netstat -ano | findstr "8765"
```
