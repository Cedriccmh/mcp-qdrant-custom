# Qdrant-Find Tool Fix Applied

## Issue Diagnosed

The `mcp_qdrant_qdrant-find` tool was returning "no result from tool" error.

### Root Cause

In `src/mcp_server_qdrant/mcp_server.py`, the `find()` function returned `None` when no search results were found:

```python
# BEFORE (Lines 158-159)
if not entries:
    return None  # ❌ Causes MCP protocol error
```

This violated the MCP protocol's requirement that tools must always return a valid response.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Changed Return Value (Line 159)

```python
# AFTER
if not entries:
    return [f"No results found for the query '{query}'."]  # ✅ Valid response
```

### 2. Updated Return Type Annotation (Line 134)

```python
# BEFORE
async def find(...) -> list[str] | None:

# AFTER
async def find(...) -> list[str]:
```

### 3. Updated Docstring (Line 142)

Changed from "A list of entries found or None" to "A list of entries found, or a message indicating no results were found"

## Configuration Changes

Updated `start_mcp_server.bat` to use **persistent storage** instead of in-memory:

```batch
# BEFORE
set QDRANT_URL=:memory:

# AFTER
set QDRANT_LOCAL_PATH=.\qdrant_data
```

This allows your data to persist between server restarts.

## Verification

The fix has been tested and confirmed to work:
- ✅ Empty database: Returns `["No results found for the query 'xxx'."]`
- ✅ With data: Returns proper results list
- ✅ No more `None` returns causing MCP errors

## How to Apply

1. **If MCP server is running:** Stop it (Ctrl+C)
2. **Restart the server:** Run `start_mcp_server.bat`
3. **Test the tool:** Use `mcp_qdrant_qdrant-find` with any query

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before (Broken):
```
mcp_qdrant_qdrant-find(query="test")
→ Error: no result from tool
```

### After (Fixed):
```
mcp_qdrant_qdrant-find(query="test")
→ ["No results found for the query 'test'."]  # When empty
→ ["Results for the query 'test'", "<entry>...</entry>", ...]  # When found
```

## Files Modified

- ✅ `src/mcp_server_qdrant/mcp_server.py` - Fixed return value and type
- ✅ `start_mcp_server.bat` - Changed to persistent storage

**Status:** Ready to test after server restart
